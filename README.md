**Title:** Use of aggregated covariates in propensity score analysis of clustered data
**Author:** Kyle Nickodem

Consider the increased presence of school resource officers (SROs) in American schools over the last 20 years. SROs are oft-armed law enforcement agents tasked with deterring misbehavior and increasing the students’ and staffs’ sense of safety in order to create a school environment conducive for learning.

*How might we determine whether the presence of an SRO has an effect on student achievement?*

Ideally, we conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), but two issues complicate such a study design:
1. Ethical and logistical feasibility of randomly assigning SROs to each school (i.e., cluster)
2. Accounting for the clustering of student achievement outcomes within schools

Propensity score methods address issue #1 and multilevel models address issue #2. Great! So, if I'm an applied researcher:

*How do I conduct a propensity score analysis using multilevel models to evaluate the impact of a cluster-level treatment on subject-level outcomes?*
